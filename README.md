## Problem being solved

Game development is becoming increasingly centralised to the biggest forces of the industry. Games exist in suspended independent universes, there is no continuity between different games in the current scope.
There can be several reasons for the end of a game, players grew out of it, the community left it or the developers decided to pull the plug.
All these reasons give the gaming companies a centralised control over gaming assets and individual game developers cannot flourish.

## Aims

With blockchain, the game and its assets can be placed on it and players can have permanent ownership of the collected asset. The developer cannot take it back even if the game shuts down. Players can communicate with any other environment on the same blockchain.
This means that avatars can bounce across multiple games. Players can exchange their game assets with other players .It would eventually lead to the formation of an integrated gaming universe which would be decentralised.

## Solution

This project is a small attempt to integrate Blockchain and gaming. The concept of integration is illustrated through a 2D platform game which stores the game assets collected on a blockchain. The storage for each session of the game is based on blockchain.
The player needs to collect coins and traffic signals which is stored as a block and appended  to the existing blockchain.
With the collection of traffic signs, some educating information is displayed.
A trivial blockchain concept implemented in Python is used for illustrating the game requirements.
After encountering any obstacle, the player dies and the current score and traffic signals are stored as a new block.

## Scope of Improvement

The game can be made multiplayer and exchange of assets can be made done using blockchain.
More levels can be added.
The game can be built to android for greater accessibility.
Customised assets can make the game more closer to the theme.
